Witchery
a poem by me

Yes it was a witch you saw
sashaying from her perch
     on the knotted pine
     to my exposed shoulder
and pecking a hole
in my tank top but I
     didn't ask her over and
          she only stayed
long enough to whisper
     in one ear
with a ragged wing wrapping
     the other
          an ancient pointless riddle

Of course I followed
     her loping step and
     sallow beckoning finger
through Bony Wood
     and down the spiral stairs
     carved into the roots
of the crabapple tree
at the center of the maze
          and candlelit we
          in her creaking
     wrought-iron four-poster
               fucked but
          it wasn't cheating
          We were on a break
